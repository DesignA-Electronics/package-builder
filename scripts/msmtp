DESCRIPTION='SMTP client
 In the default mode, it transmits a mail to an SMTP server
 (for example at a free mail provider) which takes care of further
 delivery.
 To use this program with your mail user agent (MUA), create a
 configuration file with your mail account(s) and tell your MUA to
 call msmtp instead of /usr/sbin/sendmail.'
