DESCRIPTION='The Virtual tab Window Manager
 VTWM, one of many TWM descendants, implements a Virtual Desktop (VD), 
 meaning that what is currently on screen is just a portion of a larger 
 workspace. What portion of the virtual desktop that is displayed, and 
 whatever windows might be visible within it, are simple point-and-click 
 operations within a scaled representation of the workspace.'
